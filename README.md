# Lightput

This is an old FTDI RS-485 to DMX project that was built using code::blocks, wxwidgets, libftdi2xx, portmidi for midi input, it used to work with VSXu which was an audio visualization software but I have not kept up with it.  The included files might still work for a windows build.

I'm working on getting this working on modern linux systems with the latest wxwidgets, etc.  It works at the moment but there are issues with saving and loading of information into text files at the moment.

sorry for the non-existant naming conventions and bad labels, this was an early project and I was just focusing on getting things working which is a style I like when I'm working solo.
